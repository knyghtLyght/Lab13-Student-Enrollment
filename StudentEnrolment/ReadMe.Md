# Student Enrollment

An exploration of the MVC structuer and .Net Core framework

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.
Included packages:
.NetCore
XUnit

## Features

You are responsible for creating a student enrollment system for a school for the school administration. We can assume that only admins will be accessing this site, so no need for authorization/authentication. Here are the requirements.

Students can only be registerd for one class at a time.
the administration should be able to view all the students enrolled in a specific course.
View all students enrolled all at once and the class they are registered for
View Course information independently.
Remove specific students
Remove courses
Seach for specific students
Search for courses
Edit a student's profile
Edit a course's information
The workflow of the website should be:

Create a new course

Create a new student

In the registration process, the student will be enrolled into a specific course
When viewing all the students, their course is visible

When viewing an individual course, all the students in that course should visible.

We can use the CRUD operations on both courses and students

You cannot remove a course if it has students enrolled in it.

Add HTML and CSS to the site to make it 'client ready'
